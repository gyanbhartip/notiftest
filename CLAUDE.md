# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository layout

Monorepo with two independent apps that talk over WebSocket:

- `frontend/` — Expo (SDK 54) / React Native 0.81 / React 19 client. Uses `pnpm` (lockfile: `pnpm-lock.yaml`). Bare workflow (`android/` is committed). Entry: `index.ts` → `App.tsx`. Notification plumbing lives under `frontend/src/service/` (`websocket.ts`, `fcm.ts`, `notifications.ts`, `deviceId.ts`). FCM handlers register in `index.ts`, not App.
- `backend/fast/` — FastAPI server managed by `uv` (Python 3.14 pinned via `.python-version`). Owns the WebSocket primary path + a test REST endpoint.
- `backend/dj/` — Django app (`fcmapp`) that receives FCM tokens from the client and (intended) sends push via Firebase for the fallback path. Project dir `fcmtest/`, app dir `fcmapp/` (views/urls/models/migrations). `fcmapp/libs/` is untracked vendored SDK material — keep it out of commits.

Client → backend env vars (both in `frontend/.env.local`, both need the `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix):

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_WS_URL` — FastAPI WebSocket endpoint, read in `src/service/websocket.ts`.
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` — Django base URL, used by `src/service/fcm.ts` to POST the FCM token to `/fcm-token/`.

## Commands

### Frontend (run from `frontend/`)

- `pnpm install` — install deps (use pnpm, not npm/yarn; the lockfile is pnpm's).
- `pnpm start` — Metro bundler / Expo dev server.
- `pnpm android` / `pnpm ios` — native build + run (these use `expo run:*`, NOT Expo Go, because Firebase + Notifee require native modules).
- `pnpm web` — web preview.

Because this is a bare Expo project with native modules, Expo Go will not work — always use a dev client build (`pnpm android` / `pnpm ios`) after changing `app.json`, adding plugins, or pulling new native deps.

### Backend (run from `backend/fast/`)

- `uv sync` — install/refresh deps from `uv.lock`.
- `uv run fastapi dev main.py` — dev server (reload enabled; listens on `127.0.0.1:8000` by default).
- `uv run fastapi run main.py` — production-style serve.
- `uv run ruff check .` / `uv run ruff format .` — lint / format (ruff is the only dev tool declared).

No test suite exists yet in either app. If you add tests, wire the commands back into this file.

Fast smoke checks (use these before claiming done):

- `cd backend/fast && uv run ruff check .` — FastAPI lint
- `cd backend/dj && uv run python manage.py check` — Django system checks
- `cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` — TypeScript check (no Metro needed)

## Architecture (the non-obvious parts)

### WebSocket fan-out via `ConnectionManager`

`backend/fast/routers/notifications.py` is the core integration point. A single in-memory `ConnectionManager` keeps a `dict[user_id, WebSocket]`. The flow:

1. Client opens `ws://<host>/api/ws/notifications?user_id=<id>` → `connect()` stores the socket keyed by `user_id`.
2. Anything (typically `POST /api/test/send-ws-notification?user_id=...`) calls `manager.send_to_user(user_id, payload)` to push JSON down that specific socket.
3. `WebSocketDisconnect` clears the entry.

Implications:

- State is process-local. Multi-worker / multi-replica deployments will break silently — only the worker that holds the socket can deliver to it. If you add workers, you must introduce a broker (Redis pub/sub, etc.) before that is safe.
- One `user_id` = one active socket. A second connect for the same user overwrites the previous one (the old socket is orphaned, not closed). Be explicit if you change that semantics.
- Router is mounted with prefix `/api`, so all paths above are served at `/api/...`. Keep client URLs in sync when editing `main.py`.

### CORS is wide open

`main.py` sets `allow_origins=["*"]` with credentials. Fine for a local test harness, not for anything shared. Tighten before deploying.

### Dual notification path (WS primary, FCM fallback)

The harness deliberately runs two delivery routes:

1. **Primary — WebSocket via FastAPI.** `src/service/websocket.ts` opens a persistent socket and calls `notifee.displayNotification(...)` directly on each message. Works only while the app is foregrounded and the socket is alive.
2. **Fallback — FCM via Django.** On mount, `src/service/fcm.ts` registers with FCM, grabs the token, and POSTs it + `device_id` to Django at `${EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL}/fcm-token/`. Django pushes via firebase_admin when WS isn't viable (background/quit). Foreground + background handlers are registered in `frontend/index.ts` (not in a component/module imported by `App.tsx`).

If you change message shape, update both `websocket.ts` (direct Notifee payload) and the FCM payload Django sends — they must produce equivalent Notifee output.

### Frontend WS lifecycle

`src/service/websocket.ts` owns a module-level singleton socket keyed by `getDeviceId()` from `src/service/deviceId.ts`. `App.tsx` subscribes to status via `onWsStatus(...)` and calls `disconnectWebSocket()` on unmount. No reconnect logic — harness only.

### Notifee + RN Firebase gotchas

- Notifee `displayNotification` requires `android.channelId` **nested**, not top-level. Django's `send_fcm_notification` builds the payload with `android: { channelId, pressAction }` — keep that shape or the handler throws silently.
- `messaging().setBackgroundMessageHandler(...)` MUST live in `frontend/index.ts` before `registerRootComponent`. Headless JS won't find it if it's only registered inside the `App` import tree.
- Always `await notifee.createChannel({ id: 'default', ... })` idempotently inside the FCM handler — background/quit path can fire before `initializeNotifee()` runs.
- Errors thrown inside `onMessage` / `setBackgroundMessageHandler` are swallowed silently by RN Firebase. Wrap display logic in `try/catch` + `console.warn`.

### Django FCM wiring

- `FCMToken` is keyed by `device_id` (unique CharField). No auth in the harness — `save_fcm_token` just upserts. Client generates `device_id` in `src/service/deviceId.ts` (random per launch).
- firebase_admin initializes via `fcmapp/apps.py` `ready()` → imports `fcmapp/libs/fcm.py`, which resolves `serviceAccountKey.json` from `__file__`. Don't move the key without updating that path.
- After changing `fcmapp/models.py`, delete `backend/dj/db.sqlite3` and re-run `uv run python manage.py migrate` — no prod data to preserve.
- URLs are mounted at project root (not `/fcmapp/...`): `POST ${API_URL}/fcm-token/` and `POST ${API_URL}/test/send-fcm/` (form data: `device_id`, `title`, `body`).

### Notifee + Maven repo wiring

`app.json` adds an `extraMavenRepos` entry pointing at `../../node_modules/@notifee/react-native/android/libs` through `expo-build-properties`. This is required for Android builds to resolve Notifee's AAR — if you restructure `node_modules` location (e.g., workspace hoisting) or change package managers, this relative path will break the Android build. Firebase is wired through `google-services.json` at `frontend/google-services.json`; package id is `com.gb.notiftest`.

## Manual testing (Postman / curl)

Prereqs: FastAPI on `:8000`, Django on `:8001`, Android app running, `deviceId` visible on screen. Replace `<host>` with the dev machine's LAN IP (or `127.0.0.1` on emulator).

### 1. Primary path — WebSocket via FastAPI

Client auto-connects on launch. To fire a notification through the open socket:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://<host>:8000/api/test/send-ws-notification?user_id=<deviceId>&title=Hello&body=from+WS"
```

Postman: `POST http://<host>:8000/api/test/send-ws-notification` with query params `user_id`, `title`, `body`. Expect tray notification + `📤 Sent WS notification to <deviceId>` in FastAPI logs.

### 2. Fallback path — FCM via Django

Token registration happens automatically on app launch (watch Django logs for `POST /fcm-token/ 200`). Then trigger a push:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://<host>:8001/test/send-fcm/" \
  -d "device_id=<deviceId>" \
  -d "title=Hello" \
  -d "body=from+FCM"
```

Postman: `POST http://<host>:8001/test/send-fcm/` with `x-www-form-urlencoded` body: `device_id`, `title`, `body`. Omit `device_id` to fan-out to every saved token. Expect Django log `✅ FCM sent to ... → projects/<proj>/messages/...` and a Metro log `📨 FCM received: ...` then a tray notification.

### Troubleshooting

- Django returns `200` but nothing on device → check Metro for `📨 FCM received`. If absent, handlers aren't registered at entry (see Notifee gotchas). If present but no tray notification, look for `FCM display failed` — most common cause is a payload shape mismatch with Notifee.
- WS curl works but FCM doesn't → put app in background before firing FCM to confirm background handler path. Foreground-only delivery means `setBackgroundMessageHandler` never ran.

## Conventions specific to this repo

- **Backend imports**: `main.py` uses `from routers.notifications import ...` (not `from .routers...`). The server must be launched from inside `backend/fast/` so that `routers/` is on `sys.path`. Don't "fix" this to a package-relative import without also restructuring launch.
- **Python version**: 3.14 is pinned. `uv` will refuse to run on older interpreters — install via `uv python install 3.14` if missing.
- **TypeScript**: `strict: true` via `expo/tsconfig.base`. Don't loosen.
- **Env vars on the client**: Only `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variables are exposed to RN code. Anything without that prefix will be `undefined` at runtime.

## Deployment model

Local-only. This repo is a notification test harness — it is not deployed and is not intended to be. That means:

- Don't suggest hardening CORS, adding Redis/pub-sub for the `ConnectionManager`, switching to multi-worker uvicorn, or adding auth to the WebSocket. Those are correct concerns for production but out of scope here.
- Single-process, single-dev-machine assumptions are fine. The in-memory `ConnectionManager` is the intended design for this harness.
- Prioritise iteration speed and readable test flows over robustness or scalability.

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->

## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

Tool names carry a `_tool` suffix (e.g. `detect_changes_tool`); under the full MCP prefix they appear as `mcp__code-review-graph__<name>`.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes_tool` or `query_graph_tool` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius_tool` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes_tool` + `get_review_context_tool` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph_tool` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview_tool` + `list_communities_tool`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

| `refactor_tool`                  | Planning renames, finding dead code                    |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes_tool` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows_tool` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph_tool` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
